STEPS AGAINST IMPOSTOR SYNDROME

First, acknowledge the thoughts, Recognize how you're feeling, and think about why you're feeling this way. Understand your own patterns and identifying situations that make you feel impostor syndrome is a helpful place to start

Second own your accomplishments. Your success is not due to luck or help from others. Your success is due to your intelligence and hard work. Take responsibility for the role you played in the accomplishment.

Third, make a list. Write down five things that show you're qualified for the job you are considering. Or write down five accomplishments you're proud of. Focus on all your unique skills you can bring to the table.

Fourth, have a conversation. To address your inner critic, it's helpful to talk about what's going on in your mind. Many people hesitate to share how they feel because they're scared about how others might respond. Remember your new mentor? I bet they still feel like an outsider sometimes too, especially when they change jobs or take on new responsibilities at work. Ask your mentor how they handle impostor syndrome.

Lastly, realize you are not alone. If you feel like an impostor, no matter what the reason, you are not the only one.
